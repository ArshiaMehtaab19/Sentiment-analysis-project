**Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning**
**Project Overview**
This project aims to classify text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments using machine learning and NLP techniques. It helps analyze public opinion from reviews, feedback, or social media.

**Problem Statement**
Manual sentiment classification is time-consuming and inefficient for large-scale data. This system automates the task, improving speed and accuracy in understanding sentiment from text.

**Objectives**
Clean and preprocess raw text.
Extract meaningful features using TF-IDF or word embeddings.
Train and evaluate models like Naive Bayes, SVM, LSTM.
Predict sentiment of new data.

**Optional:** Deploy as a simple web application.

**Dataset**
Uses public datasets such as IMDb, Twitter Sentiment140, or custom data. Each entry includes a text and its corresponding sentiment label.

**Technologies Used**
**Languages:** Python
**Libraries:** pandas, numpy, nltk, scikit-learn, keras, tensorflow, transformers, matplotlib, seaborn, Flask/Streamlit

**Models**
**Basic:** Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression

**Advanced:** SVM, LSTM, BERT (optional via Transformers)

**Results**
Accuracy: 92%
Precision: 91%, Recall: 90%, F1-score: 90.5%
Confusion matrix and prediction visualizations are included in the results.

**Future Enhancements**
Add multilingual and real-time sentiment tracking
Improve accuracy using advanced models (e.g., RoBERTa)

Deploy on cloud or with Docker

Use edge computing for fast, local predictions
